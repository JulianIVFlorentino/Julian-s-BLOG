        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Julian IV J. Florentino, a passionate Information Systems student with a knack for technology and a love for learning. Currently in my third year of college, Iâ€™m on a journey to explore the vast world of information technology and systems.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My goal is to become a successful content creator in the Web3 space, sharing insights on topics like NFTs and DeFi. When I'm not immersed in tech, I enjoy creative storytelling, connecting with people, and sharing knowledge to inspire others.</p>
